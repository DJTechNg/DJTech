In as much as it is important for companies to maintain originality and stick to branding, it is also advisable to rebrand and move with the trends and flow with the vogue, and right now what is trending are websites and mobile apps. For why you need a website check out our previous blog <a href=\"http://djtech.com.ng/relevance-of-a-website-in-todays-business-society\">post</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are reasons why your company or brand needs a mobile app;</p>\n<p><strong>1. Provide value to your customers</strong></p>\n<p>Business is all about reciprocation, and that is making your customers feel that you appreciate their contribution to your company or you value their input through money, this can be done by creating a loyalty program within the app, saying &#8216; buy one online, get one free.&#8217; That is going to stir up customers to use the application and feel they are appreciated for using it.<a href=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/app.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-239\" src=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/app-300x239.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"239\" srcset=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/app-300x239.jpg 300w, http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/app.jpg 597w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>2. Build a stronger brand</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most important things a mobile app offers to consumers is awareness of and communication with your brand. And through that regular interaction with your target market, you’re fostering trust.</p>\n<p>The more your audience trusts you, the more likely they’ll be to listen to later sales pitches and even commit to your brand. With an app, you’ll demonstrate to your users why they should trust you by showing (rather than telling) what your brand stands for.<br />\nCheck out this data from Red Hot Mobile Maturity Survey 2015;<a href=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mobile-maturity.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-238\" src=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mobile-maturity-300x134.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"134\" srcset=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mobile-maturity-300x134.jpg 300w, http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mobile-maturity.jpg 609w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><a href=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mobile-presence.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-237\" src=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mobile-presence-300x187.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\" srcset=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mobile-presence-300x187.jpg 300w, http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mobile-presence.jpg 655w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 14.4px;\">3. Boost Profits</strong></p>\n<p>When customers satisfaction increases, so does sales. According to salesforce,<em> 70% of buying experience are influenced by how customers feel they are being treated.</em> So an app gives you a certain level of communication with customers, that you have a chance to make everybody feel special, and a chance to personally appreciate them.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>According to techcrunch.com 34.4% of black Friday sales last year were completed on mobile devices. Also, 90% of companies planned to increase investment in mobile apps in 2016, and they all did that, there is a good chance of your brand or company being left behind, if you don&#8217;t jump on the train&#8230;..</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170723_094855.jpg\">    </a><a href=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mobile-apps1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-258 size-medium\" src=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mobile-apps1-300x180.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" srcset=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mobile-apps1-300x180.jpg 300w, http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mobile-apps1-768x461.jpg 768w, http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mobile-apps1-1024x614.jpg 1024w, http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mobile-apps1.jpg 1210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></strong></p>\n<p>In conclusion, there are so many other reasons why getting a mobile app is the next important step to take right now, ranging from standing out, giving you the ability to <strong><em>connect better with customers(major or primary purpose of mobile presence),</em></strong> because if customer service is top priority as it should be, mobile app has become the answer, also there is the point of reaching the younger demographs, inform users about new services and products by syncing them via their social media accounts and emails, thereby giving them the first hand information service.<a href=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/industry.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-236\" src=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/industry-300x136.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"136\" srcset=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/industry-300x136.jpg 300w, http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/industry.jpg 682w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8216;Get you brand or company an application today with us at djtech, where customer satisfaction is put before any other thing.&#8217;<a href=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170723_094855.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-235\" src=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170723_094855-300x212.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"212\" srcset=\"http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170723_094855-300x212.jpg 300w, http://djtech.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170723_094855.jpg 691w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></em></p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Don&#8217;t forget to share this post! </strong></em></p>\n",
